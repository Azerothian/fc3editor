Hello  Matthew Mckenzie (azeroth48),

I don't know how to contact you, I wrote you a E-mail but you didn't wrote back. So I decide to make a File in this Far cry 3 Editor Source Code. 
I will write here what I wrote to you in the E-mail. :) :


Far Cry 3 Map editor and Project


Hey Matthew Mckenzie,

I've found your decompiled source for the Far Cry 3 Map Editor and I've been wondering,
that due to your name you might be interested in World of Warcraft.
You may have heared of the map editor for World of Warcraft: Noggit.
My question is, if you have ever considered in trying to convert the Far Cry 3 Map Editor into a
World of Warcraft map editor.
We have a team with a few scripters who should be able to help you if you would attempt to try to convert it.
If you're interested or you want to hear more about the Map Editor for World of Warcraft and maybe even consider
working with us then it would be nice if you could write a quick reply.

I'm looking forward to hear from you.

Regards
