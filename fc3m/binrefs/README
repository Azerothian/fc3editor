    Please visit http://www.codeplex.com/easyhook for more information
    about the project and latest updates.

PLEASE NOTE:
    The LGPL allows you to sell propritary software based on this library
    (EasyHook) without releasing the source code for your application.
    This is a big difference to the original GPL. Refer to the attached
    "LICENSE" document for more information about the LGPL!
 
    To wrap it up (without warranty):
        
        1)  You are granted to sell any software that uses EasyHook over
            DLL or NET bindings. This is covered by the native API and the 
            managed interface.
        2)  You are NOT granted to sell any software that includes parts
            of the EasyHook source code or any modification! If you want
            to modify EasyHook, you are forced to release your work under
            the LGPL or GPL... Of course this only applies to the library
            itself. For example you could release a modification of EasyHook
            under LGPL, while still being able to release software, which
            takes advantage of this modification over DLL or NET bindings,
            under a proprietary license!
        3)  You shall include a visible hint in your software that EasyHook
            is used as module and also point out, that this module in
            particular is released under the terms of the LGPL and NOT
            under the terms of your software (assuming that your software
            has another license than LGPL or GPL).
 
    I decided to release EasyHook under LGPL to prevent commercial abuse
    of this free work. I didn't release it under GPL, because I also want to
    address commercial vendors which are more common under Windows.

BUG REPORTS:

    Reporting bugs is the only chance to get them fixed! Don't consider your
    report useless... I will fix any serious bug within a short time! Bugs with
    lower priority will always be fixed in the next release...

DONATIONS:

    I want to add support for Itanium (II - III) processors. If you have any hardware
    that you don't need anymore or could donate, which >supports< a recent Windows
    Itanium edition (Windows license is not required), please contact me. Of course we 
    could discuss a reasonable sponsorship reference for your company. Money for
    buying such hardware is also appreciated...

***************************************************** 2) How to compile
*********************************************************************************************

Since EasyHook 2.5, compilation is dramatically simplified. Just compile once
for "x64" and once for "x86". The native EasyHook DLLs will automatically be
copied into their counterpart arch directory. 

The you will have to copy the following files into any desired "Deploy" directory:

"Debug\x64\EasyHook64.dll" -> "Deploy\EasyHook64.dll"
"Debug\x64\EasyHook64Svc.dll" -> "Deploy\EasyHook64Svc.dll"
"Debug\x86\EasyHook32.dll" -> "Deploy\EasyHook32.dll"
"Debug\x86\EasyHook32Svc.dll" -> "Deploy\EasyHook32Svc.dll"
"Debug\x64\EasyHook.dll" -> "Deploy\EasyHook.dll"
"Debug\x64\EasyHook.dll.xml" -> "Deploy\EasyHook.dll.xml"
"Debug\x86\EasyHook32Drv.sys" -> "Deploy\EasyHook32Drv.sys"
"Debug\x64\EasyHook64Drv.sys" -> "Deploy\EasyHook64Drv.sys"


Of course this is not necessary for testing purposes. As long as you keep
all test applications in either the "x86" or "x64" directory, they will
run properly. The "Deploy" directory is meant to contain all files necessary
to ship an application based on EasyHook. This is what you get with the
"Binaries Only" package.

***************************************************** 3) Prerequisites
*********************************************************************************************

Since the CRT is now statically compiled into the DEBUG version, you won't
need the Visual Studio Redistributable package anymore. The RELEASE version
will compile without CRT, which heavily reduces the resulting binary size!
For testing purposes I would always recommend to use the DEBUG version...
